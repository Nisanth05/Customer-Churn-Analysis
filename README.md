### Objective
The main goal of this project is to use Power BI to analyze and visualize customer data, identify key factors that lead to customer churn, and create a dashboard that can be used to monitor churn metrics. The project aims to provide actionable insights that can help the company reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies

### Findings
 *Customer Overview
 
Total Customers: 64.37K customers are being analyzed.
Churned Customers: Out of the total, 30K customers have churned, indicating a churn rate of approximately 46.6%.

 *Churn by Contract Length
 
Monthly Contracts: Highest churn with 11K customers.
Annual Contracts: Moderate churn with 10K customers.
Quarterly Contracts: Lowest churn with 9K customers.
The monthly contract length shows the highest churn rate, suggesting that customers with shorter contracts are more likely to churn.

 *Churn by Usage Frequency
 
The chart indicates a correlation between churn and usage frequency.
Lower usage frequency is associated with higher churn, especially in the range of 0-500 churned customers.

 *Churn by Gender
 
Female Customers: 19K total, with 15K churned (approx. 43.7% churn rate).
Male Customers: 12K total, with 18K churned (approx. 60% churn rate).
Conclusion: Males have a higher churn rate compared to females.

 *Churn by Age
 
Churn increases with age, with noticeable spikes around the age of 40 and again around the age of 60.
The sum of churn is higher for customers in the older age brackets (40+).

### Recommendations
- High-Risk Segments: Older customers, customers with monthly contracts, and male customers represent higher churn risks.
- Customer Retention Focus: Strategies should be focused on retaining customers with monthly contracts and older customers, as they are more likely to churn.
- Targeted Interventions: Special attention may be required for customers with low usage frequency to prevent churn.
